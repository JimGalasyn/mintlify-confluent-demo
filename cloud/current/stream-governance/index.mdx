## Demo: Overview of Stream Governance

This video demo shows how Confluent Stream Governance takes a fresh approach to data governance. Stream Governance not only enables data in motion, but also gives you the real-time data governance tools built to help foster secure, compliant, and scalable collaboration and knowledge sharing necessary to become a real-time, event-centric business.

## Data governance

Data governance initiatives aim to manage the availability, integrity, and security of data used across an organization. With the explosion in volume, variety, and velocity of data powering the modern enterprise, it’s no surprise that the management of that data has become paramount to the success of companies across the globe. Data governance is now a mainstream, mandatory, and critical force behind the “data everywhere” movement.

At its core, a data governance program consists of three key areas:

## Governance for Data in Motion

With the sharp rise of real-time data, the need for organizational governance over data in motion is growing quickly. As investments into microservices increase and data sources scale, it becomes more and more challenging for any individual or team to understand or govern the full scope of streams flowing across the business.

To enable a generation of event-centric enterprises, Confluent developed Stream Governance: governance built for data in motion, allowing businesses to operate around a central nervous system of real-time data.

With Confluent’s Stream Governance, companies can confidently share the power of data in motion across the organization with a governance solution designed for the intricacies of streaming data.

## Stream quality

Confluent’s stream quality tools enable teams to deliver a scalable supply of trusted event streams throughout the business, enabling reliable delivery of mission-critical applications, confident decision making, and a simplified design for data standards. These tools set and control the data rules and definitions by which the entire system operates. This determines what data gets in and what data does not, all in the spirit of maintaining high data integrity.

- [Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/sr/schemas-manage.html#sr-prv) allows teams to define and enforce universal data standards that enable scalable data compatibility while reducing operational complexity. Avro, JSON, and Protobuf serialization formats are supported.
- [Data Contracts and Data Quality Rules](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/sr/fundamentals/data-contracts.html#sr-data-contracts) are supported in Schema Registry to expand on schemas and provide formal agreement between producers and consumers on the structure, evolution, and integrity constraints on data exchange. Data quality rules can specify the semantics of data fields, detail constraints on the data (such as requiring positive values for certain fields), describe the evolution and compatibility of schemas, and indicate data ownership.
- [Schema Validation](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/sr/broker-side-schema-validation.html#cloud-schema-validation), enabled at the topic-level, ensures broker/registry coordination by verifying that schemas tied to incoming messages are both valid and assigned to the specific destination topic in order to publish.
- [Schema Linking](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/sr/schema-linking.html#schema-linking) keeps schemas in sync across Schema Registry clusters. Optionally, use it in combination with [Geo-replication with Cluster Linking on Confluent Cloud](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/multi-cloud/cluster-linking/index.html#cloud-cluster-linking) to keep both schemas and topic data in sync across Schema Registry and Kafka clusters.
