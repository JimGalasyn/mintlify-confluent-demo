## Minor Upgrades for Confluent Cloud

Any change to Confluent Cloud services that isn’t a major upgrade or deprecation.

**Potential customer impact**

- Minimal: standard Kafka state changes that clients handle gracefully, for example leader elections.
- None: totally transparent, depending on customer usage of the service.

**Examples**

- Kafka cluster roll.
- Upgrading Kafka to a fully backwards-compatible version.
- Adding new features.

**Frequency**

Very often, e.g., multiple times per day.

**Communication before the change**

Prior communication is done only when necessary. Communication may include email notifications, in-app messaging, updated documentation and release notes, and/or communication from Sales and customer operations.

**Timing of the change for each customer**

100% at Confluent’s discretion.

## Major Upgrades for Confluent Cloud

Any change to Confluent Cloud services that requires code changes to any customer applications (Kafka clients, API integrations, etc) to continue working as before.

**Potential customer impact**

- Large: could prevent use of service without code or configuration changes, or could problematically alter the performance profile.
- None: totally transparent, depending on customer usage of the service.

**Examples**

- Upgrading Kafka to a version that is not fully backwards-compatible with the previous version.
- Updating a public API from `api/v1/foo` to `api/v2/foo`.
- Security update that materially changes cluster or client throughput.

**Frequency**

Rare (~1 per year)

**Communication before the change**

- Guaranteed: multiple email notifications to all registered Confluent Cloud users, starting at least 180 days before the upgrade date, with details about the change and available options.
- May also include: in-app messaging; updated documentation and release notes; communication from Sales and customer support.

**Timing of the change for each customer**

May be coordinated with customers to avoid high-risk times and make the upgrade sooner, but the final date set by Confluent is not negotiable.

## Deprecations for Confluent Cloud

Any removal of customer-usable functionality from Confluent Cloud services.

**Potential customer impact**

- Large: could prevent use of service if the customer relies on the feature.
- None: totally transparent, depending on customer usage of the service.

**Examples**

- Complete removal of a feature from the UI.
- Shutting down `api/v1/foo`.
- Removing a particular Connector as an option.

**Frequency**

Rare (~1 per year)

**Communication before the change**

- Guaranteed: multiple email notifications to all registered Confluent Cloud users, starting at least 180 days before the deprecation date, with details about the change and available alternatives.
- May also include: in-app messaging; updated documentation and release notes; communication from Sales and customer support.

**Timing of the change for each customer**

100% at Confluent’s discretion.

**Notes**

Deprecations may be part of major upgrades (no guarantee of equivalent functionality in new versions).
