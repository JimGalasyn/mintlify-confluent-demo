<Accordion title="What version of Kafka does Confluent Cloud use?">
Confluent Cloud is built upon a cloud-native Kafka engine, Kora, that maintains strict compatibility with and tracks the latest version of Apache Kafka®. Client compatibility is covered in depth in our [Clients Overview documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-client/overview.html).

Confluent Platform builds on a subset of the Kora engine, but does not share the same release cycle as Confluent Cloud. For more details of Confluent Platform compatibility, see [Confluent Platform support versions](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/versions-interoperability.html).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What client and protocol versions are supported?">
- Confluent Cloud follows the Confluent Platform [client version support policy](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/versions-interoperability.html#cp-ak-compatibility).
- To connect to Confluent Cloud, compatible clients must support and implement TLS encryption and SASL\_PLAIN or SASL\_OAUTHBEARER (with OAuth-OIDC configured) authentication.
- All client features since 0.10.0.0 are supported, including exactly-once delivery semantics.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What security, compliance, and privacy features does Confluent Cloud provide?">
Confluent's product offerings are designed to support the needs of enterprise customers for security, compliance, and privacy. For information on compliance and security, see the [Trust & Security page](https://www.confluent.io/trust-and-security/?session_ref=direct&url_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.confluent.io%2Fcloud%2Fcurrent%2Ffaq.html) page.

See [What specific security features does Confluent Cloud offer?](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/#security-features) for more details about security features.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What specific security features does Confluent Cloud offer?">
- All traffic over the wire requires TLS 1.2 encryption and authentication for SASL\_PLAIN or SASL\_OAUTHBEARER (with OAuth-OIDC identity provider configured).
- All data is encrypted at rest on encrypted volumes. Confluent Cloud ensures encryption on customer data stored at rest through the native encryption services offered by our cloud providers.
- [BYOK encryption](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/security/encrypt/byok/overview.html#byok-encrypted-clusters) is supported for data at rest for Dedicated clusters on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
- You control the API keys and secrets specific to your cluster which you can revoke or reissue if necessary.
- All data is stored on secure infrastructure, with access controls that are restricted to Confluent engineers, inside a Confluent controlled VPC.
- Confluent Cloud Dedicated clusters provide dedicated compute and storage resources.
- [VPC Peering (optional)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/networking/overview.html#cloud-networking) provides network-level security for customers with Dedicated Clusters in Confluent Cloud.
- [Single sign-on (SSO)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/security/authenticate/user-identities/user-idps/sso/overview.html#sso-saml) using your existing SAML-based identity provider (IdP). Confluent Cloud SSO provides access control for multiple independent software systems.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What version of TLS is supported on Confluent Cloud?">
TLS version 1.2 is supported.

<Important>
Effective March 15, 2020, connections made by using TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer supported. TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are legacy cryptographic protocols that do not support modern cryptographic algorithms. They contain security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. The Internet Engineering Task Force is planning to officially [deprecate both protocols](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate-00?session_ref=direct&url_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.confluent.io%2Fcloud%2Fcurrent%2Ffaq.html). The majority of encrypted internet traffic is now over TLS 1.2. TLS 1.2 has been the recommended version for IETF protocols since 2008.
</Important>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is Kerberos supported on Confluent Cloud?">
Kerberos authentication is not supported.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are Confluent Cloud IP addresses and hostnames static?">
In most cases, no. Because the cloud infrastructure used by Confluent Cloud does not guarantee static IP addresses or hostnames across cluster changes, DNS is used to provide a consistent address. The underlying IP addresses and hostnames might be stable for a period of time, but are subject to change at any time, so they should not be relied upon for any use.

Confluent provides egress public IP addresses that you can use for communicating between Kafka clusters (with public networking) in Confluent Cloud and external data sources and sinks. For more information, see [Use Public Egress IP Addresses on Confluent Cloud for Connectors and Cluster Linking](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/networking/static-egress-ip-addresses.html#static-egress-ip-addresses) and [Public IP address for Confluent Cloud connectors](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/static-egress-ip.html#cc-static-egress-ips).

- Planned changes to the list of public egress IP addresses is considered a Major Upgrade and we will follow the policy outlined in [Major Upgrades for Confluent Cloud](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/release-notes/upgrade-policy.html#major-ccloud-upgrade).
- In the event of an unplanned change, Confluent will send out notifications as soon as possible.
- You may be required to take immediate action to update your firewall rules.

The following blogs describe how the common outbound proxies handle IP address changes:

- [DNS for Service Discovery in HAProxy - HAProxy Technologies](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/dns-service-discovery-haproxy/?session_ref=direct&url_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.confluent.io%2Fcloud%2Fcurrent%2Ffaq.html).
