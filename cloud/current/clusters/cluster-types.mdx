## Cluster types

Confluent Cloud offers these Kafka cluster types:

- Basic clusters - Used for experimentation, early development and basic use cases.
- Standard clusters - Used for production-ready features and functionality.
- Enterprise clusters - Used for production-ready functionality that requires private networking capabilities.
- Dedicated clusters - Used for critical production workloads with high traffic or private networking requirements.
- Freight clusters - Used for high-throughput, relaxed latency workloads that are less expensive than self-managed open source Kafka.


<Accordion title="Freight cluster considerations">
- Freight clusters are currently available in select AWS regions. For more information, see [Cloud Providers and Regions for Confluent Cloud](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/clusters/regions.html#providers-regions).
- You must optimize the clients you use to connect to Freight clusters. For more information, see [Freight Clients for Confluent Cloud](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/client-apps/optimizing/freight.html#freight-latency-clients).
- Freight clusters do not support the following:
	- Idempotent producer
	- Transactions
- Freight clusters do not support the following metrics and functions:
	- `DELETE_RECORDS`
	- `REPLICA_STATUS`

<Tip>
**Tip**

If you need a region that is not yet available, submit a request by providing your requested AWS region on this [Freight cluster site](https://events.confluent.io/freight-clusters-are-now-generally-available?session_ref=direct&url_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.confluent.io%2Fcloud%2Fcurrent%2Fclusters%2Fcluster-types.html).
</Tip>

### Cluster provisioning and scaling

Confluent uses billing units to provision and scale clusters.

**Elastic scaling**

Basic, Standard, Enterprise, and Freight clusters are elastic, shrinking and expanding automatically based on load. You don’t resize these clusters (unlike Dedicated clusters). When you need more capacity, your cluster expands up to the fixed ceiling. If you’re not using capacity above the minimum, you’re not paying for it. If you’re at zero capacity, you don’t pay for anything. For more information, see [Elastic Confluent Unit for Kafka](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/billing/overview.html#e-cku-definition) and [eCKU/CKU comparison](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/clusters/#e-cku-details).

<Accordion title="Freight clusters scaling considerations">
Freight clusters are elastic, scaling automatically based on load, so you only pay for the eCKUs you use. However, Freight clusters may not scale as quickly as other eCKU clusters. In general, Freight clusters can support an additional 4 eCKU of capacity (240 MBps of ingress / 720 MBps of egress) every 10 minutes. If you workload grows faster than this, you may experience higher latency or failed requests. As your workload decreases, you pay for your actual eCKU usage.

In scenarios where you expect a large, rapid increase in traffic, consider contacting your account team to get Confluent to work with you to meet your request.
</Accordion>

**Manual scaling**

Dedicated clusters are provisioned and billed in terms of Confluent Unit for Kafka (CKU). CKUs are a unit of horizontal scalability in Confluent Cloud that provide a preallocated amount of resources. How much you can ingest and stream per CKU depends on a variety of factors including client application design and partitioning strategy. For more information, see [Monitor Dedicated Clusters in Confluent Cloud](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/monitoring/cluster-load-metric.html#monitor-dedicated-clusters) and [Dedicated Cluster Performance and Expansion in Confluent Cloud](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/monitoring/monitor-performance.html#cloud-cluster-monitor-performance).

### Minimum/maximum eCKU requirements

The table below lists minimum and maximum requirements for elastic cluster types. Dedicated clusters have CKU limits that depend on billing and other factors. For more information, see [CKU purchase limits](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/clusters/#cku-limits-per-cluster).

<Info>
**Limited Availability of 32 eCKU maximum Enterprise clusters**

Enterprise clusters that scale to 32 eCKU maximum (current limit is 10) are in Limited Availability and available by request. To sign up, contact [Confluent](https://events.confluent.io/signup-32eckucapacity?session_ref=direct&url_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.confluent.io%2Fcloud%2Fcurrent%2Fclusters%2Fcluster-types.html).
</Info>

| Cluster type SKU | Minimum eCKU | Maximum eCKU |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Basic | 1 | 50 |
| Standard | 1 (99.9% SLA), 2 (99.99% SLA) | 10 |
| Enterprise | 1 (99.9% SLA), 2 (99.99% SLA) | 10 <sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(current maximum)</sup>/ 32 <sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(Limited Availability)</sup> |
| Freight | 2 | 152 |

### CKU purchase limits

Dedicated clusters can be purchased in any whole number of CKUs up to the limit.

- For organizations with credit card billing, the upper limit is 4 CKUs per Dedicated cluster. Clusters up to 152 <sup>*</sup> CKUs are available by request.
- For organizations with integrated cloud provider billing or payment using an invoice, the upper limit is 24 CKUs per Dedicated cluster. Clusters up to 152 <sup>*</sup> CKUs are available by request.

For clusters that can scale to 152 <sup>*</sup> CKU, contact [Confluent Support](https://support.confluent.io/?session_ref=direct&url_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.confluent.io%2Fcloud%2Fcurrent%2Fclusters%2Fcluster-types.html) to discuss the onboarding process and product considerations.

Single-zone clusters can have 1 or more CKUs, whereas multi-zone clusters, which are spread across three availability zones, require a minimum of 2 CKUs. Zone availability cannot be changed after the cluster is created.

\* AWS and Google Cloud support Kafka clusters to 152 CKUs. Azure supports Kafka clusters to 100 CKUs.

### Fixed limits and recommended guidelines

CKUs determine the capacity of your cluster. For a Confluent Cloud cluster, the expected performance for any given workload is dependent on a variety of dimensions, such as message size and number of partitions.

There are two categories of CKU dimensions:

- Dimensions with a [fixed limit](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/clusters/#fixed-limit) that cannot be exceeded.
- Dimensions with a more flexible [guideline](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/clusters/#guideline) that may be exceeded depending on the overall cluster load.

The recommended guideline for a dimension is calculated for a workload optimized across the dimensions, enabling high levels of CKU utilization as measured by the [cluster load metric](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/monitoring/cluster-load-metric.html#cloud-cluster-load-metric). You may exceed the recommended guideline for a dimension, and achieve higher performance for that dimension, usually only if your usage of other dimensions is less than the recommended guideline or fixed limit.

Also note that usage patterns across all dimensions affect the workload and you may not achieve the suggested guideline for a particular dimension. For example, if you reach the partition limit, you will not likely reach the maximum CKU throughput guideline.

You should monitor the [cluster load metric](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/monitoring/cluster-load-metric.html#cloud-cluster-load-metric) for your cluster to see how your usage pattern correlates with cluster utilization.

When a cluster’s load metric is high, the cluster may delay new connections and/or throttle clients in an attempt to ensure the cluster remains available. This throttling would register as non-zero values for the producer client [produce-throttle-time-max and produce-throttle-time-avg metrics](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/client-apps/monitoring.html#producer-throttling) and [consumer client fetch-throttle-time-max and fetch-throttle-time-avg metrics](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/monitoring.html#fetch-metrics-kafka).

#### Dimensions with fixed limits

The following dimensions have fixed limits that you cannot exceed:

- Storage (pre-replication)
- Partitions (pre-replication)
- Connection attempts
- Kafka REST Produce v3
- Kafka REST Admin v3

#### Dimensions with recommended guidelines

These dimensions provide guidelines for capacity planning. The ability to fully utilize these dimensions depend on the workload and utilization of other dimensions. See more about measuring load in [cluster load metric](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/monitoring/cluster-load-metric.html#cloud-cluster-load-metric) and for the maximum bandwidth for each cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), are available in [Benchmark Your Dedicated Apache Kafka Cluster on Confluent Cloud](https://assets.confluent.io/m/2d7c883a8aa6a71d/original/20200501-WP-Benchmark_Your_Dedicated_Apache_Kafka_Cluster_on_Confluent_Cloud.pdf?session_ref=direct&url_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.confluent.io%2Fcloud%2Fcurrent%2Fclusters%2Fcluster-types.html).

The following dimensions come with recommended guidelines:

- Ingress
- Egress
- Total client connections
- Requests

\* Limit based on Elastic Confluent Unit for Kafka (eCKU). You only pay for the capacity you use up to the limit. For more information, see [Elastic Confluent Unit for Kafka](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/billing/overview.html#e-cku-definition).

† Limit based on a Dedicated Kafka cluster with 152 CKU. For more information, see [CKU purchase limits](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/clusters/#cku-limits-per-cluster) and [Confluent Unit for Kafka](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/billing/overview.html#cku-definition).

\*† Basic clusters are limited to one task per connector. You can deploy 250 connectors to a Basic cluster but each connector can only have one task. If you need more than one task, upgrade your cluster.

The capabilities provided in this topic are for planning purposes, and are not a guarantee of performance, which varies depending on each unique configuration.

### Migrate from open source Kafka

If you are currently self-managing Kafka, use the following information to help choose which cluster type best suits your use-cases. For information about migrating from open source Kafka to Confluent Cloud, see the [Migrating from Kafka services to Confluent](https://assets.confluent.io/m/2745775bbd1fa224/original/20240425-EB-Migrating_From_Kafka_To_Confluent.pdf?session_ref=direct&url_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.confluent.io%2Fcloud%2Fcurrent%2Fclusters%2Fcluster-types.html) PDF.

- Ingress: Use [producer outgoing-byte-rate metrics](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/monitoring.html#producer-global-request-metrics) and [broker kafka.server:type=BrokerTopicMetrics,name=BytesInPerSec metrics](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/monitoring.html#kafka-monitoring-metrics-broker) to understand your throughput.
- Egress: the [consumer incoming-byte-rate metrics](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/monitoring.html#consumer-global-request-metrics) and [broker kafka.server:type=BrokerTopicMetrics,name=BytesOutPerSec](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/monitoring.html#kafka-monitoring-metrics-broker) to understand your throughput.
- Storage (pre-replication): Use the amount of disk space your cluster is using to understand your storage needs.
- Partitions (pre-replication): Use the `kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=GlobalPartitionCount` metric to understand your partition usage. Find details in the [Broker section](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/monitoring.html#kafka-monitoring-metrics-broker).
- Total client connections: Use the [broker kafka.server:type=socket-server-metrics,listener=`{listener_name}`,networkProcessor=`{#}`,name=connection-count metrics](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/monitoring.html#kstypesocketservermetrics) to understand how many connections you are using. This value may not have a 1:1 ratio to connections in Confluent Cloud, depending on the number of brokers, partitions, and applications in your self-managed cluster.
- Connection attempts: Use the rate of change for the [kafka.server:type=socket-server-metrics,listener=`{listener_name}`,networkProcessor=`{#}`,name=connection-count](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/monitoring.html#zk-metrics) metric and the Consumer `connection-creation-rate` metric to understand how many new connections you are creating. For details, see [Broker Metrics](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/monitoring.html#kstypesocketservermetrics) and [Global Connection Metrics](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/monitoring.html#consumer-metric-global-connection-metrics).
- Requests: Use the [broker kafka.network:type=RequestMetrics,name=RequestsPerSec,request=`{Produce, Fetch, Consumer, FetchFollower}` metrics](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/monitoring.html#kafka-monitoring-metrics-broker) and [client request-rate metrics](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/monitoring.html#kafka-monitoring-metrics-producer) to understand your request volume.

## Partition guidelines

The partition guidelines that follow are based on benchmarking and intended as practical recommendations for planning purposes. Performance per partition varies depending on your individual configuration, and these benchmarks do not guarantee performance.

Except for Basic clusters, all clusters offer:

- Unlimited storage per partition
- Unlimited storage per partition for compacted topics

Basic clusters offer:

- 5 TB per partition
- 5 TB per partition for compacted topics

Use the table below to compare partition guidelines across cluster types.

| Dimension | Basic | Standard | Enterprise | Dedicated | Freight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ingress per partition | ~5 MBps | ~5 MBps | ~6 MBps | ~12 MBps (aggregate producer throughput) | ~6 MBps |
| Egress per partition | ~15 MBps | ~15 MBps | ~18 MBps | ~36 MBps (aggregate producer throughput) | ~18 MBps |
